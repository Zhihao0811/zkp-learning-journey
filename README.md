*A finite element algorithm engineer transitioning into zero-knowledge proof engineering.*

## 👋 About Me

Hi, I'm **Zhang Zhihao** — a UNSW Civil Engineering MSc graduate and a senior finite element algorithm developer with **5+ years of C++ / numerical methods / sparse matrix computing** experience.

In the past five years, I focused on:

* 🧮 Large-scale sparse matrix solving & numerical optimization
* 📘 Constraint satisfaction problem modeling
* 🧵 Parallel computing (OpenMP / multi-threaded optimization)
* 🎛️ GPU-accelerated computing (CUDA kernels / parallel numerical routines)
* 📐 Complex physical system modeling & finite element simulation
* ⚙️ Designing high-performance C++ algorithmic components


Now I’m pivoting into **Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP)** engineering — combining my strong numerical background with cutting-edge cryptography & blockchain technologies.

🎯 **Goal:** Become a remote ZK Engineer in US / EU / SG / HK blockchain teams.

## 🚀 Why I’m Transitioning to ZKP

Finite element algorithms trained me to think in:

✓ constraints
✓ structured computation
✓ optimization
✓ parallelism
✓ correctness

ZKPs are *mathematical constraint systems* too — but used to verify computations without revealing data.
My numerical background gives me natural advantages in:

* ZK circuit design
* R1CS / PLONK constraint engineering
* Witness generation pipeline
* Multi-threaded proving system optimization
* Memory/performance profiling

This learning journey is about converting those strengths into a full ZKP skill set.
