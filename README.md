# zkp-learning-journey

I am a finite element algorithm developer pivoting to zero-knowledge proof engineering.

With 5 years of expertise in:
• Large-scale sparse matrix solving and optimization
• Numerical methods for constraint satisfaction problems
• Parallel computation and performance optimization
• Mathematical modeling of complex physical systems

Applying these advanced numerical skills to ZK circuit design and proof system optimization.

🎯 Target: Remote ZK Engineer roles in US/EU/SG/HK blockchain teams
