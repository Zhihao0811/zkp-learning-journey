# zkp-learning-journey

I am a finite element algorithm developer pivoting to zero-knowledge proof engineering.
With 5 years of experience solving complex constraint systems in FEA,
I'm now applying those skills to ZK circuit design and optimization.

🎯 Target: Remote ZK Engineer roles in US/EU/SG/HK blockchain teams
